Exercism exercise API

This codebase collects all the exercises and metadata that make up the problem
sets for exercism.io.

The exercises for each language are stored in separate repositories, included
here as git submodules. This codebase provides an API for serving the Exercism
exercises to people using the Exercism command-line client.
