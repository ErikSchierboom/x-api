Open a terminal window and run the following command to install minitest:\n\n    gem install minitest\n\nIf you would like color output, you can `require 'minitest/pride'` in\nthe test file.\n\nIn order to run the test, you can run the test file from the exercise directory. For example, if the test suite is called `hello_world_test.rb`, you can run the following command:\n\n    ruby hello_world_test.rb\n\n## Source\n\nJavaRanch Cattle Drive, exercise 3 [view source](http://www.javaranch.com/leap.jsp)\n",
