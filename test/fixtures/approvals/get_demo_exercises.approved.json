This is your first error message.\n.\nFirst it tells you the name of the file where the error is occurring:\n\n    bob_test.rb\n.\nThen it tells you which line that error is on:\n\n    bob_test.rb:4\n.\nAfter that, it tells you the name of the method where the error is occurring:\n\n    in `require_relative'\n.\nNext, it tells you exactly what the error is:\n\n    #{e.message.split('--').first}\n.\nFinally, it tells you which file is missing:\n\n    #{e.message.split('--').last}\n.\nSo the error is there on line 4 of this file (bob_test.rb).  What's on line 4?\n\n    require_relative 'bob'\n\nWe are trying to require the file, and it isn't there.\n.\nYou can fix the problem by creating an empty file named bob.rb inside\nof the ruby/bob directory.\n\nThen run this test again (ruby bob_test.rb).  Make all the tests pass,\nand submit your solution (exercism submit bob.rb).\n\nMore instructions are in README.md in this directory. Good luck!\n",
